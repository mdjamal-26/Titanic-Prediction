# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction

The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

## 📌 Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular beginner-friendly datasets for learning machine learning.  
In this project, I:
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature engineering).
- Trained different ML models to predict survival.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following key features:
- **PassengerId** – Unique ID for each passenger  
- **Pclass** – Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
- **Name, Sex, Age** – Passenger details  
- **SibSp** – Number of siblings/spouses aboard  
- **Parch** – Number of parents/children aboard  
- **Ticket, Fare, Cabin** – Ticket details  
- **Embarked** – Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)  
- **Survived** – Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
